# Mountain-Rescue-Simulator-Achievement-Fix
Very rough fix for the last achievement in the Mountain Rescue Simulator game on Steam.
More information can be found in this Steam guide.

# Installation
1) Download the Assembly-CSharp.dll file
2) Replace with it the file in your "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mountain Rescue Simulator\Mountain Rescue Simulator_Data\Managed" directory.

Afterwards the achievement should be unlockable once you finish the last mission.

If for some reason the mod doesn't work, you may try to create it yourself according to the Steam guide linked above. 
(since all the work of finding the bug was already done and described there, making the changes should be trivial)
